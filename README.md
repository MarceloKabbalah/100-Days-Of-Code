### Day 0: January 1. Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I started the first day with basic Javascript functions to create a simple timer.

**Thoughts:** Starting a new learning cycle and I immediately started using sass / scss for the first time, really good.

### Day 1: January 2. Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I started building a Reddit search app very late today so I didn't even use css, but I will pass some cosmetics later.

**Thoughts:** Today I consumed my first API using the Reddit API and ParcelJS, spent some time trying to run ParcelJS directly from VSCode and found that it didn't work because I had to enable "Developer Mode" and PowerShell execution scripts. "I also learned how to use search and tried to use the ES6.

### Day 2: January 3. Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I started building a Pet Finder app very late again, too without css, but I will pass some cosmetics later.

**Thoughts:** Today's process was similar to yesterday's, this time with ParcelJS already set up and accompanied by babel, the only problem I had was with the API geolocation because it only allows to be used in the US and Canada, but nothing that a VPN doesn't solve :).

### Day 3: January 4. Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Today I started with a very simple Javascript calculator and ended the day using some cosmetics with sass / scss. 

**Thoughts:** Surprisingly, it seemed to be the hardest job so far, because I got lost in the middle :). I will improve the functions and pass a little more cosmetics in the coming days.
