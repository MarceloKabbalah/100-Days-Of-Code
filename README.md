### Day 0: January 1. Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I started the first day with basic Javascript functions to create a simple timer.

**Thoughts:**: Starting a new learning cycle and I immediately started using sass / scss for the first time, really good.

### Day 1: January 2. Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I started building a Reddit search app very late today so I didn't even use css, but I will pass some cosmetics later.

**Thoughts:**: Today I consumed my first API using the Reddit API and ParcelJS, spent some time trying to run ParcelJS directly from VSCode and found that it didn't work because I had to enable "Developer Mode" and PowerShell execution scripts. "I also learned how to use search and tried to use the ES6.

### Day 2: January 3. Friday

**Today's Progress**: I started building a Pet Finder app very late again, too without css, but I will pass some cosmetics later.

**Thoughts:**: Today's process was similar to yesterday's, this time with ParcelJS already set up and accompanied by babel, the only problem I had was with the API geolocation because it only allows to be used in the US and Canada, but nothing that a VPN doesn't solve :).

### Day 3: January 4. Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Today I started with a very simple Javascript calculator and ended the day using some cosmetics with sass / scss.

### Day 4: January 5. Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Today I started with a very simple quiz made in Javascript using local Json.

### Day 5: January 6. Monday 

**Today's Progress**: Today I started with a simple Node.js Passport Login screen, in the future I will put some cosmetics with sass / scss.

**Thoughts:**: I really didn't like using ejs templates because it uses  scriptlet as syntax and that reminds me a lot of Java Servlet(I Hate Servlet X_X), but it's part of learning @ _ @.
Very easy and practical to use the passport/passport-local library but I had a big problem with bcrypt, initially 
initially i wanted to use "bcrypt" but I was giving incompatibility with Node version so I ended up using "bcryptJS" and as the syntax is a bit different I had to see the documentation to be able to continue the project of the day.

### Day 6: January 7. Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Today I started with a simple Real Time Chat App With Node.js And Socket.io, in the future I will put some cosmetics with sass / scss.

**Thoughts:**: Extremely easy to use socket.io, I found it very simple and intuitive to use it. I liked it so much that I'm thinking of putting a chat in my profile for those who visit me to leave a message :) but I'll do it with VueJS and Flask.
